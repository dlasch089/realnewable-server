# realnewable Server (in Node.js)

This API is part of an open source project, developed in the scope of a master thesis at the Technical University of Munich. It is providing developers with the day-ahead information of the entso-e transparency platform (https://transparency.entsoe.eu/), in JSON-format for Germany. 

A possible usage of the API is the web app called "realnewable", calculating the momentum of electricity consumption for German end-consumers: https://realnewable.herokuapp.com

**Note: the app is currently running on a free plan of heroku and will therefore take some time to restart the server at the first call.**

Everybody is invited to contribute in the project. 

For further questions, please contact: d.lasch@tum.de

# Usage

The API can be accessed through **https://realnewable-server.herokuapp.com/**, which also states the **base url** for the following routes. 

For using the API you can fork or clone this repository and change the .env-variables to your specific frontend application. Please be aware of the CORS-settings in this app, which is not automatically whitelisting all requesting apps. Additionally, you need to define your API-key in the .env. 

The .env-file should contain the following:

MONGODB_URI=mongodb://*your database*

ENTSOE_KEY = *your security token*

CLIENT_URL = *your client URL*

## How to get your own ENTSO-E security token:

## Local Development

Please ensue the following steps for running the app locally. 
*Note: the realnewable API is written in Node.js with the express framework, using npm (https://www.npmjs.com/) as package management system. The author is recommending to use Visual Studio Code on Mac for development*

1. Fork the project
2. Use *npm install* to install all node-modules
3. Run *nodemon start*
4. App listens on port 3000 (e.g. http://localhost:3000/forecast/solar/germany)
